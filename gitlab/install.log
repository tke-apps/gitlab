WARNING: Automatic TLS certificate generation with cert-manager is disabled and no TLS certificates were provided. Self-signed certificates were generated.

You may retrieve the CA root for these certificates from the `gitlab-wildcard-tls-ca` secret, via the following command. It can then be imported to a web browser or system store.

    kubectl get secret gitlab-wildcard-tls-ca -ojsonpath='{.data.cfssl_ca}' | base64 --decode > gitlab.example.com.ca.pem

If you do not wish to use self-signed certificates, please set the following properties:
  - global.ingress.tls.secretName
  OR
  - global.ingress.tls.enabled (set to `true`)
  - gitlab.webservice.ingress.tls.secretName
  - registry.ingress.tls.secretName
  - minio.ingress.tls.secretName
WARNING: Automatic TLS certificate generation with cert-manager is disabled and no TLS certificates were provided. Self-signed certificates were generated that do not work with gitlab-runner. Please either disable gitlab-runner by setting `gitlab-runner.install=false` or provide valid certificates.

NOTICE: You've installed GitLab Runner without the ability to use 'docker in docker'.
The GitLab Runner chart (gitlab/gitlab-runner) is deployed without the `privileged` flag by default for security purposes. This can be changed by setting `gitlab-runner.runners.privileged` to `true`. Before doing so, please read the GitLab Runner chart's documentation on why we
chose not to enable this by default. See https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/kubernetes.html#running-docker-in-docker-containers-with-gitlab-runners
